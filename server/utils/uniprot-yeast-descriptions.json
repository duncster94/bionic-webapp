Thereby, frees ribosomes from the stalled translation complex and prevents the accumulation of nascent polypeptide chains that are potentially toxic for the cell (PubMed:23178123). RQC2 is responsible for selective recognition of stalled 60S subunits by recognizing an exposed, nascent chain-conjugated tRNA moiety (PubMed:25349383). RQC2 is important for the stable association of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase RKR1/LTN1 to the complex (PubMed:23479637).

The sequential action of ESCRT-0, -I, and -II together with the ordered assembly of ESCRT-III links membrane invagination to cargo sorting (PubMed:12194857). Membrane scission in the neck of the growing vesicle releases mature, cargo-laden ILVs into the lumen (PubMed:24139821, PubMed:24711499). ESCRT-III is critical for late steps in MVB sorting, such as membrane invagination and final cargo sorting and recruitment of late-acting components of the sorting machinery (PubMed:24139821, PubMed:24711499). SNF7 is the most abundant ESCRT-III subunit which forms membrane-sculpting filaments with 30 Angstrom periodicity and a exposed cationic membrane-binding surface (PubMed:26670543). Its activation requires a prominent conformational rearrangement to expose protein-membrane and protein-protein interfaces (PubMed:26670543). SNF7 filaments then form spirals that could function as spiral springs (PubMed:26522593). The elastic expansion of compressed SNF7 spirals generates an area difference between the two sides of the membrane and thus curvature which could be the origin of membrane deformation leading eventually to fission (PubMed:26522593). SNF7 recruits BRO1, which in turn recruits DOA4, which deubiquitinates cargos before their enclosure within MVB vesicles (PubMed:11029042, PubMed:15935782).

The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.9). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732).

    "MSH6": "Component of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system (MMR). Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS alpha, which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH6 provides substrate-binding and substrate specificity to the complex. When bound, MutS alpha bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. Acts mainly to repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication, but can also repair longer insertion-deletion loops (IDLs), although with decreasing efficiency as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis by the MutS alpha complex is crucial for MMR. Both subunits bind ATP, but with differing affinities, and their ATPase kinetics are also very different. MSH6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, whereas MSH2 catalyzes ATP at a substantially slower rate. Binding to a mismatched base pair suppresses MSH6-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, but not the activity of MSH2. ATP binding to both subunits is necessary to trigger a change in MutS alpha interaction with mismatched DNA, converting MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent movement along DNA, and also facilitates formation of ternary complexes containing MutS and MutL proteins and the mismatch. May also be involved in resolution of recombination intermediates.",

    "ERG4": "C-24(28) sterol reductase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (PubMed:8125337, PubMed:12882006) (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.9). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

    "ERG3": "C-5 sterol desaturase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.10). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

    "MSH2": "Component of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system (MMR). Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer), which bind to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. MSH2 seems to act as a scaffold for the other MutS homologs that provide substrate-binding and substrate specificity. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shield approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha acts mainly to repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches that occur during replication, but can also repair longer insertion-deletion loops (IDLs), although with decreasing efficiency as the size of the extrahelical loop increases. MutS beta acts mainly to repair IDLs from 2 to 13 nucleotides in size, but can also repair base-base and single insertion-deletion mismatches. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta form a ternary complex with a MutL heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. Both subunits bind ATP, but with differing affinities, and their ATPase kinetics are also very different. MSH6 binds and hydrolyzes ATP rapidly, whereas MSH2 catalyzes ATP at a substantially slower rate. Binding to a mismatched base pair suppresses MSH6-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, but not the activity of MSH2. ATP binding to both subunits is necessary to trigger a change in MutS alpha interaction with mismatched DNA, converting MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent movement along DNA, and also facilitates formation of ternary complexes containing MutS and MutL proteins and the mismatch. MutS beta also has a role in regulation of heteroduplex formation during mitotic and meiotic recombination. MutS beta binds to DNA flap structures predicted to form during recombination, and is required for 3' non-homologous tail removal (NHTR). MutS beta-binding alters the DNA conformation of its substrate at the ds/ssDNA junction and may facilitate its recognition and/or cleavage by the downstream nucleotide excision repair (NER) RAD1-RAD10 endonuclease.",

Sumoylated EUC1 acts a cofactor required for the recruitment of the SLX5/SLX8 STUbL complex via specific contacts between EUC1 and SLX5, as well as an additional SUMO-mediated interaction (PubMed:31015336). SLX5/SLX8 then ubiquitinates EUC1 and presumably other targets at ub-hotspots, and the CDC48/UFD1/NPL4 complex, together with UBX4 and UBX5, removes Lys-48-linked ubiquitinated proteins from chromatin. Ubiquitinated proteins could be either degraded by the proteasome or recycled by deubiquitination (PubMed:31015336). EUC1 itself does not seem to underlie extensive turnover, as it is a very stable protein (PubMed:31015336). EUC1 is able to act as a transcription factor, but its function at ub-hotspots does not seem to depend on this ability (PubMed:31015336).

    "RPO21": "DNA-dependent RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA using the four ribonucleoside triphosphates as substrates. Largest and catalytic component of RNA polymerase II which synthesizes mRNA precursors and many functional non-coding RNAs. Forms the polymerase active center together with the second largest subunit. Pol II is the central component of the basal RNA polymerase II transcription machinery. During a transcription cycle, Pol II, general transcription factors and the Mediator complex assemble as the preinitiation complex (PIC) at the promoter. 11-15 base pairs of DNA surrounding the transcription start site are melted and the single-stranded DNA template strand of the promoter is positioned deeply within the central active site cleft of Pol II to form the open complex. After synthesis of about 30 bases of RNA, Pol II releases its contacts with the core promoter and the rest of the transcription machinery (promoter clearance) and enters the stage of transcription elongation in which it moves on the template as the transcript elongates. Pol II appears to oscillate between inactive and active conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. Elongation is influenced by the phosphorylation status of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II largest subunit (RPB1), which serves as a platform for assembly of factors that regulate transcription initiation, elongation, termination and mRNA processing. Pol II is composed of mobile elements that move relative to each other. The core element with the central large cleft comprises RPB3, RBP10, RPB11, RPB12 and regions of RPB1 and RPB2 forming the active center. The clamp element (portions of RPB1, RPB2 and RPB3) is connected to the core through a set of flexible switches and moves to open and close the cleft. A bridging helix emanates from RPB1 and crosses the cleft near the catalytic site and is thought to promote translocation of Pol II by acting as a ratchet that moves the RNA-DNA hybrid through the active site by switching from straight to bent conformations at each step of nucleotide addition. In elongating Pol II, the lid loop (RPB1) appears to act as a wedge to drive apart the DNA and RNA strands at the upstream end of the transcription bubble and guide the RNA strand toward the RNA exit groove located near the base of the largely unstructured CTD domain of RPB1. The rudder loop (RPB1) interacts with single-stranded DNA after separation from the RNA strand, likely preventing reassociation with the exiting RNA. The cleft is surrounded by jaws: an upper jaw formed by portions of RBP1, RPB2 and RPB9, and a lower jaw, formed by RPB5 and portions of RBP1. The jaws are thought to grab the incoming DNA template, mainly by RPB5 direct contacts to DNA.",

    "SPT7": "Functions as component of the transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA, SALSA and SLIK. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA.

The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain.

    "ERG24": "Delta(14)-sterol reductase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (PubMed:8125337) (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.8). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

TORC1 positively controls protein biosynthesis by regulation of mRNA stability, translation initiation factor activity, and high-affinity amino acid permeases that serve to provide amino acids for use by the translation machinery. TORC1 also promotes growth by sequestering a number of nutrient and general stress-responsive transcription factors in the cytoplasm. TORC1 negatively controls macroautophagy, a process to recycle surplus cytoplasmic mass under nutrient starvation conditions. TORC1 controls many of these processes via TIP41-TAP42-mediated inhibition of the type 2A-related phosphatases PP2A and SIT4 (PubMed:10198052, PubMed:10329624, PubMed:10604478, PubMed:11741537, PubMed:15620355, PubMed:7606777, PubMed:8741837, PubMed:9539725, PubMed:9843498). In nutrient rich conditions, responsible for the phosphorylation of AGC S6 kinase (S6K) YPK3, activating YPK3 kinase activity and promoting phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (PubMed:25767889). Phosphorylates kinase SCH9 at 6 amino acids in the C-terminus, activating SCH9 kinase activity to properly regulate ribosome biogenesis, translation initiation, and entry into stationary phase (PubMed:17560372).

Most of the produced acetaldehyde is subsequently reduced to ethanol, but some is required for cytosolic acetyl-CoA production for biosynthetic pathways. The enzyme is also one of five 2-oxo acid decarboxylases (PDC1, PDC5, PDC6, ARO10, and THI3) able to decarboxylate more complex 2-oxo acids (alpha-keto-acids) than pyruvate, which seem mainly involved in amino acid catabolism. Here the enzyme catalyzes the decarboxylation of amino acids, which, in a first step, have been transaminated to the corresponding 2-oxo acids. In a third step, the resulting aldehydes are reduced to alcohols, collectively referred to as fusel oils or alcohols. Its preferred substrates are the transaminated amino acids derived from threonine (2-oxobutanoate), norvaline (2-oxopentanoate), valine (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate, also alpha-keto-isovalerate), isoleucine ((3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, also alpha-keto-beta-methylvalerate), phenylalanine (phenylpyruvate), and tryptophan (3-(indol-3-yl)pyruvate), whereas transaminated leucine is no substrate. In a side-reaction the carbanionic intermediate (or active aldehyde) generated by decarboxylation or by activation of an aldehyde can react with an aldehyde via condensation (or carboligation) yielding a 2-hydroxy ketone, collectively called acyloins. The expression level of this protein in the presence of fermentable carbon sources is so low that it cannot compensate for the other two pyruvate decarboxylases to sustain fermentation.",

    "ERG6": "Sterol 24-C-methyltransferase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (PubMed:6363386) (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.9). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

    "ERG1": "Squalene epoxidase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962) (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.9). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",
    "TAF14": "Functions as a component of the DNA-binding general transcription factor complex TFIID, the RNA polymerase II associated general transcription factor complex TFIIF, and the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIIF is essential for the initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase II (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449). TFIIF functions include the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter bound DNA-TBP-TFIIB complex, decreasing the affinity of RNA polymerase II for non-specific DNA, allowing for the subsequent recruitment of TFIIE and TFIIH, and facilitating RNA polymerase II elongation (PubMed:10788514, PubMed:12138208, PubMed:12516863, PubMed:9618449, PubMed:30385749). TAF14 acts as a chromatin reader that specifically recognizes and binds histones that are acylated (PubMed:26341557, PubMed:27089029). Recognizes and binds histone H3 acetylated or crotonylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9ac and H3K9cr, respectively), with some preference for crotonylated lysine (PubMed:26341557, PubMed:27089029, PubMed:30385749). Component of the SWI/SNF complex, an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex, is required for the positive and negative regulation of gene expression of a large number of genes (PubMed:12672490). It changes chromatin structure by altering DNA-histone contacts within a nucleosome, leading eventually to a change in nucleosome position, thus facilitating or repressing binding of gene-specific transcription factors (PubMed:12672490). Component of the histone acetyltransferase NuA3 complex, that acetylates Lys-14 of histone H3. Recruitment of NuA3 to nucleosomes requires methylated histone H3 (PubMed:17157260).

The protease activity is required for proteolytic activation of ATG8: cleaves the C-terminal amino acid of ATG8 to reveal a C-terminal glycine (PubMed:11038174, PubMed:11100732, PubMed:11149920, PubMed:11904149, PubMed:16680092, PubMed:18701704, PubMed:18725539, PubMed:8050581, PubMed:8224160, PubMed:9649430). ATG8 ubiquitin-like activity requires the exposure of the glycine at the C-terminus for its conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and its insertion to membranes, which is necessary for autophagy (PubMed:11038174, PubMed:11100732, PubMed:11149920, PubMed:11904149, PubMed:16680092, PubMed:18701704, PubMed:18725539, PubMed:8050581, PubMed:8224160, PubMed:9649430). The ATG8-PE conjugate mediates tethering between adjacent membranes and stimulates membrane hemifusion, leading to expansion of the autophagosomal membrane during autophagy (PubMed:17632063). In addition to the protease activity, also catalyzes deconjugation of PE-conjugated forms of ATG8 during macroautophagy: ATG8 delipidation is required to release the protein from membranes, which facilitates multiple events during macroautophagy, and especially for efficient autophagosome biogenesis, the assembly of ATG9-containing tubulovesicular clusters into phagophores/autophagosomes, and for the disassembly of PAS-associated ATG components (PubMed:22240591, PubMed:22652539, PubMed:28330855, PubMed:28821724, PubMed:28704456). ATG8 delipidation by ATG4 also recycles ATG8-PE generated on inappropriate membranes to maintain a reservoir of unlipidated ATG8 that is required for autophagosome formation at the PAS (PubMed:22240591, PubMed:22652539).",

Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.7). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

Pheromone-activated FUS3 functions by inhibiting the binding of the transcriptional activator STE12 to filamentation specific genes while inducing its binding to and activity at mating specific genes. Non-activated FUS3 has a repressive effect on STE12 transcriptional activity.

In early mitosis, the APC/C is activated by CDC20 and targets securin PDS1, the B-type cyclin CLB5, and other anaphase inhibitory proteins for proteolysis, thereby triggering the separation of sister chromatids at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. In late mitosis and in G1, degradation of CLB5 allows activation of the APC/C by CDH1, which is needed to destroy CDC20 and the B-type cyclin CLB2 to allow exit from mitosis and creating the low CDK state necessary for cytokinesis and for reforming prereplicative complexes in G1 prior to another round of replication.",

The Hsp70-protein substrate interaction depends on ATP-binding and on allosteric regulation between the NBD and the SBD. The ATP-bound state is characterized by a fast exchange rate of substrate (low affinity state), while in the ADP-bound state exchange is much slower (high affinity state). During the Hsp70 cycle, the chaperone switches between the ATP-bound state (open conformation) and the ADP-bound state (closed conformation) by major conformational rearrangements involving mainly the lid domain. Ssb cooperates with a specific Hsp40/Hsp70 co-chaperone termed the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), which stimulates the ATPase activity of the ribosome-associated pool of Ssbs and switches it to the high affinity substrate binding state.

The ATP-bound state is characterized by a fast exchange rate of substrate (low affinity state), while in the ADP-bound state exchange is much slower (high affinity state). During the Hsp70 cycle, the chaperone switches between the ATP-bound state (open conformation) and the ADP-bound state (closed conformation) by major conformational rearrangements involving mainly the lid domain. Ssb cooperates with a specific Hsp40/Hsp70 co-chaperone termed the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), which stimulates the ATPase activity of the ribosome-associated pool of Ssbs and switches it to the high affinity substrate binding state.

Substrate preference is phosphatidylserine > phosphatidylinositol > phosphatidylcholine > phosphatidylethanolamine (PubMed:10231538, PubMed:10497163). The substrate specificity is pH- and ion-dependent.

    "TAF6": "Functions as a component of the DNA-binding general transcription factor complex TFIID and the regulatory transcription regulatory histone acetylation (HAT) complexes SAGA, SALSA and SLIK. Binding of TFIID to a promoter (with or without TATA element) is the initial step in preinitiation complex (PIC) formation. TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8). SAGA acetylates nucleosomal histone H3 to some extent (to form H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H3K18ac and H3K23ac). SAGA interacts with DNA via upstream activating sequences (UASs). SALSA, an altered form of SAGA, may be involved in positive transcriptional regulation. SLIK is proposed to have partly overlapping functions with SAGA. It preferentially acetylates methylated histone H3, at least after activation at the GAL1-10 locus.",

    "ERG26": "Sterol-4-alpha-carboxylate 3-dehydrogenase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (PubMed:9811880) (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.7). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

    "ERG25": "C-4 methylsterol oxidase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (PubMed:8552601, PubMed:12880870) (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.10). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

    "ERG8": "Phosphomevalonate kinase; part of the second module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the middle steps of the pathway (PubMed:1645230) (Probable). The second module is carried out in the vacuole and involves the formation of farnesyl diphosphate, which is also an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone, dolichol, heme and prenylated proteins (Probable). Activity by the mevalonate kinase ERG12 first converts mevalonate into 5-phosphomevalonate (PubMed:1645230). 5-phosphomevalonate is then further converted to 5-diphosphomevalonate by the phosphomevalonate kinase ERG8 (PubMed:1846667). The diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase MVD1/ERG19 then produces isopentenyl diphosphate (PubMed:8626466, PubMed:9244250). The isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase IDI1 then catalyzes the 1,3-allylic rearrangement of the homoallylic substrate isopentenyl (IPP) to its highly electrophilic allylic isomer, dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) (PubMed:2681212, PubMed:2223785, PubMed:7908830).

TFIID plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression by RNA polymerase II through different activities such as transcription activator interaction, core promoter recognition and selectivity, TFIIA and TFIIB interaction, chromatin modification (histone acetylation by TAF1), facilitation of DNA opening and initiation of transcription. SAGA is involved in RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional regulation of approximately 10% of yeast genes. At the promoters, SAGA is required for recruitment of the basal transcription machinery. It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8).

Activity of the transcription factor is controlled through oxidation of specific cysteine residues resulting in the alteration of its subcellular location. Oxidative stress (as well as carbon stress, but not increased temperature, acidic pH, or ionic stress) induces nuclear accumulation and as a result YAP1 transcriptional activity. Activation by hydrogen peroxide or thiol-reactive chemicals elicit distinct adaptive gene responses.

KSS1 activity is down-regulated by FUS3 during pheromone induction to prevent inappropriate activation of the filamentation pathway. During induction of filamentation, KSS1 activates the transcription factor STE12 resulting in its binding to and activation of filamentation specific genes. Non-activated KSS1 has a kinase-independent repressive effect on STE12 transcriptional activity, that is mediated by direct binding to STE12 and depends on the presence of DIG1 and DIG2, and that is required for the suppression of filamentation under normal growth conditions. SSN3/SRB10 contributes further to the suppression of filamentation under these conditions by reducing STE12 stability independent of KSS1.

Involved in chromosome segregation, where it is required for meiosis I spindle dissambly as well as for establishing two consecutive chromosome segregation phases. Allows damaged actomyosin rings to be maintained to facilitate completion of cell division in response to minor perturbation of the cell division machinery. Inhibits transcription of ribosomal genes (rDNA) during anaphase and controls segregation of nucleolus by facilitating condensin targeting to rDNA chromatin in anaphase. Dephosphorylates SIC1, a CDC28 inhibitor, and SWI5, a transcription factor for SIC1, and induces degradation of mitotic cyclins, likely by dephosphorylating the activator of mitotic cyclin degradation, CDH1.

    "ERG5": "C-22 sterol desaturase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (PubMed:8635732, PubMed:8543054) (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.9). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

The cytochrome b-c1 complex catalyzes electron transfer from ubiquinol to cytochrome c, linking this redox reaction to translocation of protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane, with protons being carried across the membrane as hydrogens on the quinol. In the process called Q cycle, 2 protons are consumed from the matrix, 4 protons are released into the intermembrane space and 2 electrons are passed to cytochrome c (Probable). Cytochrome c1 is a catalytic core subunit containing a c-type heme. It transfers electrons from the [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster of the Rieske protein to cytochrome c (PubMed:18390544).",

The exchange of GDP for GTP on the G protein alpha subunit alters its interaction with the G protein beta subunit STE4, leading to dissociation of the G protein beta-gamma dimer STE4-STE18. The dissociated subunits activate downstream effectors to activate the mating response pathway and induce changes necessary to produce mating-competent cells.

It influences RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity through different activities such as TBP interaction (SPT3, SPT8 and SPT20) and promoter selectivity, interaction with transcription activators (GCN5, ADA2, ADA3 and TRA1), and chromatin modification through histone acetylation (GCN5) and deubiquitination (UBP8).

In the presence of GTP, eIF-2 forms a ternary complex with initiator tRNA Met-tRNAi and then recruits the 40S ribosomal complex and initiation factors eIF-1, eIF-1A and eIF-3 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC), a step that determines the rate of protein translation. The 43S PIC binds to mRNA and scans downstream to the initiation codon, where it forms a 48S initiation complex by codon-anticodon base pairing. This leads to the displacement of eIF-1 to allow GTPase-activating protein (GAP) eIF-5-mediated hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP. Hydrolysis of GTP and release of Pi, which makes GTP hydrolysis irreversible, causes the release of the eIF-2-GDP binary complex from the 40S subunit, an event that is essential for the subsequent joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit to form an elongation-competent 80S ribosome. In order for eIF-2 to recycle and catalyze another round of initiation, the GDP bound to eIF-2 must be exchanged with GTP by way of a reaction catalyzed by GDP-GTP exchange factor (GEF) eIF-2B.",
    "LSM8": "Component of the nuclear LSM2-LSM8 complex, which is involved in splicing of nuclear mRNAs. LSM2-LSM8 associates with multiple snRNP complexes containing the U6 snRNA (U4/U6 snRNP, spliceosomal U4/U6.U5 snRNP, and free U6 snRNP). It binds directly to the U6 snRNA and plays a role in the biogenesis and stability of the U6 snRNP and U4/U6 snRNP complexes. It probably also is involved in degradation of nuclear pre-mRNA by targeting them for decapping. LSM2-LSM8 probably is involved in processing of pre-tRNAs, pre-rRNAs and U3 snoRNA.

    "ERG7": "Lanosterol synthase; part of the third module of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway that includes the late steps of the pathway (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197) (Probable). The third module or late pathway involves the ergosterol synthesis itself through consecutive reactions that mainly occur in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197) (Probable). Firstly, the squalene synthase ERG9 catalyzes the condensation of 2 farnesyl pyrophosphate moieties to form squalene, which is the precursor of all steroids (PubMed:1807826, PubMed:8323279). Squalene synthase is crucial for balancing the incorporation of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into sterol and nonsterol isoprene synthesis (PubMed:9742963). Secondly, the squalene epoxidase ERG1 catalyzes the stereospecific oxidation of squalene to (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene, which is considered to be a rate-limiting enzyme in steroid biosynthesis (PubMed:1743514, PubMed:8358382, PubMed:9450962). Then, the lanosterol synthase ERG7 catalyzes the cyclization of (S)-2,3 oxidosqualene to lanosterol, a reaction that forms the sterol core (PubMed:1731628, PubMed:12842197). In the next steps, lanosterol is transformed to zymosterol through a complex process involving various demethylation, reduction and desaturation reactions (Probable). The lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase ERG11 (also known as CYP51) catalyzes C14-demethylation of lanosterol to produce 4,4'-dimethyl cholesta-8,14,24-triene-3-beta-ol, which is critical for ergosterol biosynthesis (PubMed:369554, PubMed:105731). The C-14 reductase ERG24 reduces the C14=C15 double bond of 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,14,24-trienol to produce 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol (PubMed:8125337). 4,4-dimethyl-cholesta-8,24-dienol is substrate of the C-4 demethylation complex ERG25-ERG26-ERG27 in which ERG25 catalyzes the three-step monooxygenation required for the demethylation of 4,4-dimethyl and 4alpha-methylsterols, ERG26 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation that results in a reduction of the 3-beta-hydroxy group at the C-3 carbon to an oxo group, and ERG27 is responsible for the reduction of the keto group on the C-3 (PubMed:8663358, PubMed:12880870). ERG28 has a role as a scaffold to help anchor ERG25, ERG26 and ERG27 to the endoplasmic reticulum and ERG29 regulates the activity of the iron-containing C4-methylsterol oxidase ERG25 (PubMed:12119386, PubMed:15522820, PubMed:15995173, PubMed:29773647). Then, the sterol 24-C-methyltransferase ERG6 catalyzes the methyl transfer from S-adenosyl-methionine to the C-24 of zymosterol to form fecosterol (PubMed:6363386). The C-8 sterol isomerase ERG2 catalyzes the reaction which results in unsaturation at C-7 in the B ring of sterols and thus converts fecosterol to episterol (Ref.11). The sterol-C5-desaturase ERG3 then catalyzes the introduction of a C-5 double bond in the B ring to produce 5-dehydroepisterol (PubMed:1864507). The C-22 sterol desaturase ERG5 further converts 5-dehydroepisterol into ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol by forming the C-22(23) double bond in the sterol side chain (PubMed:8543054, PubMed:8635732). Finally, ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraen-3beta-ol is substrate of the C-24(28) sterol reductase ERG4 to produce ergosterol (PubMed:8125337).",

Cytochrome c oxidase is the component of the respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of oxygen to water.

Its role in cellular physiology is to improve mitochondrial performance (By similarity). CL is critical for the coassembly of lipids and proteins in mitochondrial membranes, for instance, remodeling of the acyl groups of CL in the mitochondrial inner membrane affects the assembly and stability of respiratory chain complex IV and its supercomplex forms (PubMed:16135531). Catalyzes the transacylacion between phospholipids and lysophospholipids, with the highest rate being between phosphatidylcholine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine or PC) and CL. Catalyzes both 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (lysophosphatidylcholine or LPC) reacylation and PC-CL transacylation, that means, it exchanges acyl groups between CL and PC by a combination of forward and reverse transacylations. Also catalyzes transacylations between other phospholipids such as phosphatidylethanolamine (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or PE) and CL, between PC and PE, and between PC and phosphatidate (1,2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate or PA), although at lower rate. Not regiospecific, it transfers acyl groups into any of the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of the monolysocardiolipin (MLCL), which is an important prerequisite for uniformity and symmetry in CL acyl distribution. Cannot transacylate dilysocardiolipin (DLCL), thus, the role of MLCL is limited to that of an acyl acceptor (By similarity). CoA-independent, it can reshuffle molecular species within a single phospholipid class (PubMed:15588229). Redistributes fatty acids between MLCL, CL, and other lipids, which prolongs the half-life of CL. Its action is completely reversible, which allows for cyclic changes, such as fission and fusion or bending and flattening of the membrane. Hence, by contributing to the flexibility of the lipid composition, it plays an important role in the dynamics of mitochondria membranes.

The septins at the bud neck serve as a structural scaffold that recruits different components involved in diverse processes at specific stages during the cell cycle. Many proteins bind asymmetrically to the septin collar. The septin assembly is regulated by protein kinases GIN4 and/or CLA4.

It seems that in S.cerevisiae cysteine biosynthesis occurs exclusively through the cystathionine pathway and not via direct incorporation of sulfur into OAS.",
    "GID8": "Required for the adaptation to the presence of glucose in the growth medium; mediates the degradation of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis when cells are shifted to glucose-containing medium (PubMed:12686616). Required for proteasome-dependent catabolite degradation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) (PubMed:12686616). Required also for cell cycle progression. Positively controls G1 and the timing of START (PubMed:15590836).",
    "SGM1": "Required for normal growth rate on galactose and mannose.",
    "MGT1": "Involved in the cellular defense against the biological effects of O6-methylguanine (O6-MeG) and O4-methylthymine (O4-MeT) in DNA. Repairs the methylated nucleobase in DNA by stoichiometrically transferring the methyl group to a cysteine residue in the enzyme. This is a suicide reaction: the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated. Prefers double-stranded DNA over single-stranded DNA as substrate.",
    "TRS85": "Specific subunit of the TRAPP III complex that acts as an autophagy-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for YPT1. TRS85 directs the TRAPP III complex to the phagophore assembly site (PAS) that is involved in autophagosome formation. Required for membrane expansion during autophagy and the CVT pathway. Required for sporulation. Has a role late in meiosis following DNA replication.",
    "RPN11": "Component of the lid subcomplex of the 26S proteasome, a multiprotein complex involved in the ATP-dependent degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. RPN11 is the only catalytically active member of the lid and serves as the essential deubiquitinase of the proteasome.",
    "HIS1": "Catalyzes the condensation of ATP and 5-phosphoribose 1-diphosphate to form N'-(5'-phosphoribosyl)-ATP (PR-ATP). Has a crucial role in the pathway because the rate of histidine biosynthesis seems to be controlled primarily by regulation of the enzymatic activity (By similarity).",
    "LAC1": "Component of the ceramide synthase complex that catalyzes the transfer of the acyl chain from acyl-CoA to a sphingoid base, with high selectivity toward hexacosanoyl-CoA (C26:0-CoA) (PubMed:15692566, PubMed:11694577). N-acylates sphinganine and phytosphingosine bases to form dihydroceramides and phytoceramides, respectively (PubMed:15692566, PubMed:11694577). Redundant with LAG1. Facilitates ER-to-Golgi transport of GPI-anchored proteins.",
    "MRPS28": "Component of the mitochondrial ribosome (mitoribosome), a dedicated translation machinery responsible for the synthesis of mitochondrial genome-encoded proteins, including at least some of the essential transmembrane subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The mitoribosomes are attached to the mitochondrial inner membrane and translation products are cotranslationally integrated into the membrane.",
    "SPC110": "Component of the spindle pole body (SPB) required for the proper execution of spindle pole body (SPB) duplication. Potential role in cross-linking filaments or anchoring other molecules. It is essential for growth.",
    "RPL15B": "Component of the ribosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex responsible for the synthesis of proteins in the cell. The small ribosomal subunit (SSU) binds messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and translates the encoded message by selecting cognate aminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules. The large subunit (LSU) contains the ribosomal catalytic site termed the peptidyl transferase center (PTC), which catalyzes the formation of peptide bonds, thereby polymerizing the amino acids delivered by tRNAs into a polypeptide chain. The nascent polypeptides leave the ribosome through a tunnel in the LSU and interact with protein factors that function in enzymatic processing, targeting, and the membrane insertion of nascent chains at the exit of the ribosomal tunnel.",
    "MET6": "Catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine resulting in methionine formation."
